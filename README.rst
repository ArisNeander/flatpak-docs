flatpak-docs
============

This is the place for Flatpak developer documentation. It can be read at `flatpak.readthedocs.io <http://flatpak.readthedocs.io/>`_.

The docs are written in `reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_. Contributions are welcome!

To build locally install ``sphinx`` and ``sphinx_rtd_theme`` and run ``make html`` in the ``docs`` directory.

For Fedora you can install it with ``dnf install python3-sphinx python3-sphinx_rtd_theme``.
