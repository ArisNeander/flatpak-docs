"Flatpak deliberately makes as few requirements of applications as possible. "
"However, a small number of standard Linux desktop conventions are expected, "
"primarily to ensure that applications integrate with Linux desktops and app "
"centers. These are listed below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../conventions.rst:6
msgid ""
"Applications that have previously targeted the Linux desktop will typically "
"need to make very few (if any) changes to conform with these standards."

msgid "Application IDs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../conventions.rst:11
msgid ""
"As described in :doc:`using-flatpak`, Flatpak requires each application to "
"have a unique identifier, which has a three-part form such as "
"``org.gnome.Dictionary``. As will be seen below and in future sections, this"
" ID is expected to be used in a number of places. Developers should follow "
"the standard `D-Bus naming conventions <https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc"
"/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names>`_ when creating their own "
"IDs. This format is already recommended by the `Desktop File specification  "
"<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-"
"spec-latest.html#file-naming>`_ and `Appstream specification  "
"<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Metadata.html"
