msgid ""
"Flatpak is a framework for distributing desktop applications on Linux. It "
"has been created by developers who have a long history of working on the "
"Linux desktop, and is run as an independent open source project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:7
msgid "Target audience"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:9
msgid ""
"Flatpak can be used by all kinds of desktop applications, and aims to be as "
"agnostic as possible regarding how applications are built. There are no "
"requirements regarding which programming languages, build tools, toolkits or"
" frameworks can be used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:11
msgid ""
"While Flatpak only runs on Linux, it can be used by applications that target"
" other operating systems, as well as those that are Linux-specific. "
"Applications can be open source or proprietary (although some distribution "
"services, like `Flathub <https://flathub.org/>`_, can have restrictions in "
"this respect)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:13
msgid ""
"The only technical requirements made by Flatpak are that applications follow"
" a small number of Freedesktop standards, in order to enable desktop "
"integration (see :doc:`conventions`)."

#: ../../introduction.rst:16
msgid "Reasons to use Flatpak"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:18
msgid ""
"Flatpak has some major advantages over other approaches to distributing "
"applications on Linux. First and foremost, Flatpak allows a single "
"application build to be installed and run on virtually any Linux "
"distribution. It can also be used in combination with `Flathub "
"<https://flathub.org/>`_, a centralized service for distributing "
"applications on all distributions. This makes it possible for application "
"developers to target the entire Linux desktop market from one place."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:20
msgid ""
"Flatpak also offers native integration for the main Linux desktops, so that "
"users can easily browse, install, run and use Flatpak applications through "
"their existing desktop environment and tools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:22
msgid "Other benefits for developers include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:24
msgid ""
"**Forward-compatibility:** the same Flatpak can be run on different versions"
" of the same distribution, including versions that haven't been released "
"yet. This doesn't require any changes or management by application "
"developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:25
msgid ""
"**Maintained platforms:** called runtimes, these contain collections of "
"dependencies, which can be used by applications, and which can take a lot of"
" the work out of application development."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Bundling:** this allows application developers to ship almost any "
"dependency or library as part of their application. This gives complete "
"control over which software is used to build applications."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:27
msgid ""
"**Consistent application environments:** because these are the same across "
"devices, applications perform as intended. This also makes it easier to "
"identify bugs and to do testing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:29
msgid ""
"Finally, while Flatpak does provide a centralized service for distributing "
"applications, it also allows decentralized hosting and distribution, so that"
" application developers or downstreams can host their own applications and "
"application repositories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:31
msgid ""
"Information about Flatpak's internals can be found in :doc:`under-the-hood`."
