"``flatpak-builder`` provides two options for exporting an application in "
"order to run it. The first is to export to a repository, from which the "
"application can be run. The second is to automatically install locally."

"The ``--repo`` option allows a repository to be specified, for the "

"Here, ``<repo>`` is a path to a repository. If no repository exists at the "
"specified location, the repository will be created. If the application is "
"already in the specified repository, ``flatpak-builder`` will add the build "
"as a new version of the existing application."

"By default, ``flatpak-builder`` splits off translations and debug "
"information into separate `.Locale` and `.Debug` extensions. These "
"extensions are automatically exported into a repository along with the "
"application."

"Though it generally isn't recommended, it is possible not to use GPG "
"verification. In this case, the ``--no-gpg-verify`` option should be used "
