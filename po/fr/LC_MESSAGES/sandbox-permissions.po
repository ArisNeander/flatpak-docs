"One of Flatpak's main goals is to increase the security of desktop systems "
"by isolating applications from one another. This is achieved using "
"sandboxing and means that, by default, applications that are run with "
"Flatpak have extremely limited access to the host environment. This "
"includes:"

"In many cases, portals use a system component to implicitly ask the user for"
" permission before granting access to a particular resource. For example, in"
" the case of opening a file, the user's selection of a file using the file "
"chooser dialog is interpreted as implicitly granting the application access "
"to whatever file is chosen."

"This approach enables applications to avoid having to configure blanket "

"Interface toolkits like GTK3 and Qt5 implement transparent support for "
"portals, meaning that applications don't need to any additional work to use "
"them (it is worth checking which portals each toolkit supports). "
"Applications that aren't using a toolkit with support for portals can refer "
"to the `xdg-desktop-portal API documentation <https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-"
"desktop-portal/portal-docs.html>`_ for information on how to use them."

#: ../../sandbox-permissions.rst:38

"While application developers have control over the sandbox permissions they "

"example, the Flathub hosting service places requirements on which "
"permissions can be used, and software on the host may warn users if certain "
"permissions are used."

msgid ""
"The ``--persist=path`` option can be used to map paths from the user's home "
