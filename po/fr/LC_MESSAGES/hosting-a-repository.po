"Flatpak repositories use archive-z2, meaning that they contain a single file"
" for each file in the application. This means that pull operations involve a"

" a revision). Creating such deltas will take up more space on the server, "
"but will make downloads much faster. This can be done with the ``build-"
"update-repo --generate-static-deltas`` option."
