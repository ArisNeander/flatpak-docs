"This page provides an overview of how Flatpak works internally. While it "
"isn't necessary to be familiar with this in order to use Flatpak, some "
"people might find it interesting. Knowing about Flatpak's architecture also "
"helps to get a better understanding of how and why it works the way it does,"
" from a user and application developer perspective."

"Flatpak is built on top of a technology called `OSTree "
"<https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/introduction/>`_, which is "
"influenced by and very similar to the Git version control system. Like Git, "
"OSTree allows versioned data to be tracked and to be distributed between "
"different repositories. However, where Git is designed to track source "
"files, OSTree is designed to track binary files and other large data."

"Internally, Flatpak therefore works in a similar way to Git, and many "
"Flatpak concepts are analagous to Git concepts. Like Git, Flatpak uses "
"repositories to store data, and it tracks the differences between versions."

"With Flatpak, each application, runtime and extension is a branch in a "
"repository. An identifier triple, such as ``com.company.App/i386/stable`` is"
" a reference to that branch. The output of a Flatpak build process is a "
"directory of files which is committed to one of these branches."

"When an application is installed with Flatpak, it is pulled from the remote "
"into a new branch in a local repository. Links are then generated which "
"point from the right places in the filesystem to the application's files in "
"the repository (these are `hard links "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link>`_, which are fast to resolve and "
"disk space efficient). In other words, every application that is installed "
"is stored in a local version control repository, and is then mapped into the"
" local filesystem."

"Version tracking is therefore a core part of Flatpak's architecture, and "
"this makes updating software to the latest version very efficient. "
"Versioning also makes rollbacks possible, so it's easy to go back to a "
"previous version, should that be required."

#: ../../under-the-hood.rst:19
msgid ""
"Storing applications in a local OSTree repository has other advantages. For "
"example, it allows files that are stored on disk to be deduplicated, so the "
"same file that belongs to multiple applications (or runtimes) is only stored"
" once."
